          <p style="text-align: justify;">This information is based on data from the United States Census Bureau from 2014. In 2014, the Affordable Care Act went into effect (Source: Wikipedia). Let's face it: a lack of income can significantly impact one's ability to live a healthy lifestyle. Obesity, smoking, and a lack of healthcare a linked to poverty rates, age, and household income in this graph.</p>

          <p style="text-align: justify;">According to this report, more smokers are found in the south, in states like West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Louisiana. Utah claims to have the fewest smokers in the United States. When comparing smokers to poverty, there is a slight upward trend.  With smoking, age does not seem to be a significant factor. When it comes to household income, though, there is a downward trend. The lower the number of smokers, the higher the profits. With smoking laws tightening and shared awareness of how smoking causes cancer, this practice is unlikely to rise in popularity in the United States.</p>
